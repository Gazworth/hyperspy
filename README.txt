Hyperspy
===========

Hyperspy is a program for hyperspectral data analysis written in Python.
 
Main features:
==============

* Reads multiple formats: NetCDF 3 and 4, Gatan's dm3, EMSA/MSA, 
FEI's ser and emi and MCR.
* Curve fitting on multidimensional data cubes with modules for 
(between others):

    * EELS core-loss ionization edges.
    * EELS Multiple Scattering
    * Fine structure fingerprinting
    * Secondary electron emission
    * Photoemission spectral lines (Gaussians, Lorentzians, Voigts) with 
    support for functional Shirley background
    
* Principal Components Analysis
* Independent components analysis
* Monte Carlo simulation
* Multiple other routines for EELS data analysis
