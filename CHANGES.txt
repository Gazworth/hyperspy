v0.2.8b 18/12/2010

Enhancements
------------
*  The data exploration code was totally rewritten. Between the enhancements 
are automatic update after spectrum and model changes. However there are some 
regressions, e.g. the second cursor feature is not yet available
* New format supported for reading: Bucker raw.
* The autosaving of Model is now disable by default (what results in a big 
performance improve when fitting simple model)

BUGs fixes
----------
* m.fit was broken for grad = True and any fitter but leastsq and odr 


v0.2.7, 01/12/2010
Enhancements
------------
* Improvements in the visual data exploring features:
	- The cursors size can be changed
	- A coordinates change update the cursors and spectrum figure
	- Enabling and disabling the 'explorer' updates the spectrum figure
	- The maps colors defaults now to gray and the cursors are colorful.
* Improvements in the model class:
	- When saving the parameters to a file the std and asm arrays are saved too.
	- Prettier plotting
	- No need to manually call the touch or set_convolution_axis methods anymore
	- Much improved performance when the model is not convolved

Bugs fixed
----------
* The calculate_thickness method was broken
* The creation of the configuration folder was broken

v0.2.6, 19/11/2010
* Added imported_parameters attribute to the Spectrum object for FEI's and DMs data format
* FEI's reader now handles properly the SIs with reversed dimensions
* Fixed the get_configuration_directory_path() that was not working

v0.2.5, 18/11/2010
* Several bugs fixed (many thanks to the reporters). Probably the most annoying one was the failure to write to the user namespace after upgrading ipython. Now the name of the subshells are again availabe in the interactive session
* Several changes to the interface.
* The documentation was updated to reflex the last changes
* The microscopes.csv file was updated so it no longer contains the Orsay VG parameters.

v0.2.4, 03/11/2010
* Added Spectrum.save_principal_components method
* The poissonian noise normalization uses a masks to avoid errors with rows or columns that are always zero
* The dm3 reader was improved and should now read most of the data types.
* The load function got a new option, data_type, that can be used to force the file to be read as a spectrum or image instead of using the autodetection (default)
* In windows it is now possible (as it always has been in linux) to start hyperspy by simply typing hyperspy in the command prompt
* Several bugs fixed

v0.2.3b, 31/10/2010 -- Initial release.
