Linux
-------

In any Debian, install the hyperspy package.

To run hyperspy open a terminal, write hyperspy and press enter.

Optional:

	Setting up independent component analysis (KICA)
	------------------------------------------------
	
	- Install octave
	- If you want it to run faster, execute the following code (just once) 
	in a terminal with root privileges type: hyperspy_compile_kica()

Note: the recommend matplotlib backend in Linux is GTKAgg.

Windows
-------

- Download and install  pythonxy http://www.pythonxy.com/ with (at least) the 
following packages: 
    Python -> wxPython, Numpy, Scipy, numexpr, matplotlib, ipython, 
    pyreadline, setuptools, ETS, sympy, MDP, pytables, netcdf
    Others -> Console2

- Change the default matplotlib backend to WXAgg by editing the matplotlibrc file.
- Install the hyperspy package

To run hyperspy open Start Menu -> PythonXY -> Improved consoles -> Ipython(mlab)
and from the ipython prompt type:
from hyperspy import *

Optional:

	Setting up independent component analysis (KICA)
	------------------------------------------------
	
	- Install the newest version of octave for windows http://octave.sourceforge.net/
	- Add octave's bin directory, e.g. C:\Octave\3.2.4_gcc-4.4.0\bin, to 
	your system path
	- If you want it to run faster, execute the following code in a python 
	console just once:
	
	from hyperspy import mva
	mva.compile_kica()
    
Note: Currently the WXAgg is not fully supported by Hyperspy. Therefore, 
for a better experience it might be possible to install pygtk 
http://www.pygtk.org and use the GTKAgg matplotlib backend. However, this 
option has not been tested by the author.
