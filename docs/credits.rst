Hyperspy was started by Francisco de la Pe√±a in 2007 under the EELSLab name.

In 2010 Stefano Mazzucco joined the project after we forked his dm3reader.

In 2011 Michael Sarahan joined the project contributing a large amount of code that he had independenly developed during the previous years.

The Hyperspy logo is a modified version of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hypercube.svg and the same GFDL license apply. Stefano Mazzucco got the idea for the logo and modified the original file.
