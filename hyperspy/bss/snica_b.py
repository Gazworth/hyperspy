    # [Y, A]
    #This is SNICA to perform blind decomposition of 
    #non-negative mixture matrix X into non-negative
    #least-dependent components Y by a constrained Monte Carlo search.
    #The estimate of the mixing matrix is given in A

    #Arguments:

    # X - input matrix of mixed signals (rows), or 
    # an estimate Y from the previous step
    #(if a multistage annealing is being performed);

    # A0 - either an identity matrix (at the first step),
    # or an estimate A from the previous step;

    # h0 - initial Monte Carlo step size (0<h0<1, of order 0.2);
    # T - Metropolis temperature parameter (of order of the mutual
    # information of pure sources)
    # M - the number of terminal Monte Carlo steps (stopping criterion)
    # Kn - the number of nearest neighbors used in the mutual information 
    # calculatioms

    #For typical values of the above parameters refer to the example
    # in test.m
