        Characterizes the peaks in the stack of images.  Creates a class member
        "peak_chars" that is a 2D array of the following form:
        - One column per image
        - 7 rows per peak located.  These rows are, in order:
            0-1: x,y coordinate of peak
            2-3: aberration of this peak from its target value
            4: height of the peak
            5: orientation of the peak
            6: eccentricity of the peak
        - optionally, 2 additional rows at the end containing the coordinates
           from which the image was cropped (should be passed as the imcoords 
           parameter)  These should be excluded from any MVA.

        Parameters:
        ----------

        peak_width : int (required)
                expected peak width.  Affects subpixel precision fitting window,
		which takes the center of gravity of a box that has sides equal
		to this parameter.  Too big, and you'll include other peaks.
        
        subpixel : bool (optional)
                default is set to False

        target_locations : numpy array (n x 2) (optional)
                array of n target locations.  If left as None, will create 
                target locations by locating peaks on the average image of the stack.
                default is None (peaks detected from average image)

        peak_locations : numpy array (n x m x 2) (optional)
                array of n peak locations for m images.  If left as None,
                will find all peaks on all images, and keep only the ones closest to
                the peaks specified in target_locations.
                default is None (peaks detected from average image)

        imcoords : numpy array (n x 2) (optional)
                array of n coordinates, to keep track of locations from which
                sub-images were cropped.  Critical for plotting results.

        target_neighborhood : int (optional)
                pixel neighborhood to limit peak search to.  Peaks outside the
                square defined by 2x this value around the peak will be excluded
                from any fitting.
        
        medfilt_radius : int (optional)
                median filter window to apply to smooth the data
                (see scipy.signal.medfilt)
                if 0, no filter will be applied.

            Function to locate the positive peaks in a noisy x-y data set.

            ---------
            subpixel : bool (optional)

            peak_width : int (optional)
                    expected peak width.  Affects subpixel precision fitting window,
                    which takes the center of gravity of a box that has sides equal
                    to this parameter.  Too big, and you'll include other peaks.
                    default is set to 10

            medfilt_radius : int (optional)
                     median filter window to apply to smooth the data
                     (see scipy.signal.medfilt)
                     if 0, no filter will be applied.
                     default is set to 5

            maxpeakn : int (optional)
                    number of maximum detectable peaks
                    default is set to 30000
